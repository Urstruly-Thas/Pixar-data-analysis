# Pixar Film Analytics - SQL Portfolio Project

## Project Background

This project dives into the business, creative, and commercial dimensions of Pixar Animation Studios using SQL-based analytics. With Pixar being a globally recognized film studio( and my personal favourite), this analysis holds relevance for multiple stakeholders:

Business Analysts & Executives: To understand what drives profitability and critical success.

Creative Teams (Writers, Directors): To assess audience reception, genre performance, and award trends.

Investors & Studio Heads: To evaluate return on investment (ROI), market timing, and long-term success patterns.

Data Enthusiasts: To demonstrate how SQL can uncover deep patterns in entertainment data.

This project uses a relational database of Pixar films structured across six core tables:

- **`pixar_filmss`** â€“ film title, release date, run time  
- **`box_office`** â€“ film title, budget, worldwide revenue  
- **`public_response`** â€“ film title, IMDb score, Rotten Tomatoes score  
- **`academy`** â€“ film title, Oscar win/nomination status  
- **`genres`** â€“ film title, genre category, genre value  
- **`pixar_people`** â€“ film title, person name, role type (Director, Screenwriter, etc.)

## ðŸ“Š Executive Summary

This SQL-driven project delivers a multi-level analysis of Pixarâ€™s cinematic universe. Using common SQL tools like joins, CTEs, window functions, and conditional logic, it uncovers key patterns that explain how and why Pixar films perform well â€” or donâ€™t â€” across financial, audience, and critical dimensions.
