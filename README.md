# Pixar Film Analytics - SQL Portfolio Project

## Project Background

This project dives into the business, creative, and commercial dimensions of Pixar Animation Studios using SQL-based analytics. With Pixar being a globally recognized film studio( and my personal favourite), this analysis holds relevance for multiple stakeholders:

Business Analysts & Executives: To understand what drives profitability and critical success.

Creative Teams (Writers, Directors): To assess audience reception, genre performance, and award trends.

Investors & Studio Heads: To evaluate return on investment (ROI), market timing, and long-term success patterns.

Data Enthusiasts: To demonstrate how SQL can uncover deep patterns in entertainment data.


## Dataset and Table Overview

This project uses a relational database of Pixar films structured across six core tables:

- **`pixar_filmss`** ‚Äì film title, release date, run time  
- **`box_office`** ‚Äì film title, budget, worldwide revenue  
- **`public_response`** ‚Äì film title, IMDb score, Rotten Tomatoes score  
- **`academy`** ‚Äì film title, Oscar win/nomination status  
- **`genres`** ‚Äì film title, genre category, genre value  
- **`pixar_people`** ‚Äì film title, person name, role type (Director, Screenwriter, etc.)

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT film, budget, box_office_worldwide,
((box_office_worldwide - budget)/budget) * 100 AS roi
FROM box_office
ORDER BY roi DESC;
Insight: Toy Story and Finding Nemo achieved extremely high ROI, proving large budgets aren't essential for profitability.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Hidden Gems
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT b.film, budget, imdb_score AS public_rating
FROM box_office b
JOIN public_response r ON b.film = r.film
WHERE imdb_score > 8 AND budget < (SELECT AVG(budget) FROM box_office)
ORDER BY budget DESC;
Insight: Films like Inside Out were made below budget average yet received strong public acclaim.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Genre Consistency
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT g.value AS genre, STDDEV(b.box_office_worldwide) AS revenue_std
FROM genres g
JOIN box_office b ON g.film = b.film
WHERE g.category = 'Genre'
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY revenue_std ASC;
Insight: Adventure and Comedy genres had lower variance in revenue ‚Äî safer for investments.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Seasonality

SELECT MONTH(f.release_date) AS month_of_release, ROUND(AVG(b.box_office_worldwide)) AS box_office
FROM pixar_filmss f
JOIN box_office b ON f.film = b.film
GROUP BY month_of_release
ORDER BY box_office DESC;
Insight: June and November were consistently high-performing months ‚Äî likely due to school breaks and holidays.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Awards vs Audience & Revenue

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_award_winners,
SUM(CASE WHEN imdb_score >= 8.0 AND box_office_worldwide > 300000000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS critically_and_commercially_successful,
ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN imdb_score >= 8.0 AND box_office_worldwide > 300000000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS success_percentage
FROM academy a
JOIN public_response p ON a.film = p.film
JOIN box_office b ON a.film = b.film
WHERE a.status = 'Won';
Insight: Only ~30‚Äì40% of award-winning films were also major hits with audiences and at the box office.

‚úÖ Recommendations
Based on the above insights, these data-backed recommendations are proposed:

Release Strategically in June/November
‚Üí Capitalize on seasonal trends for maximum box office potential.

Focus on Adventure-Comedy Genres
‚Üí Proven low-risk, high-return genres in both ROI and ratings.

Invest in Proven Creatives
‚Üí Continue working with directors and writers like John Lasseter with a strong track record.

Avoid Over-Budgeting
‚Üí Films above the ~$137M average don‚Äôt necessarily perform better ‚Äî smart budgeting is key.

Maximize Post-Theatre Value for Award Films
‚Üí Even without strong public ratings, Oscar wins can drive streaming, merch, and licensing revenue.
