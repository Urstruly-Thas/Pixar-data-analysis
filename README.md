# Pixar Film Analytics - SQL Portfolio Project

## Project Background

This project dives into the business, creative, and commercial dimensions of Pixar Animation Studios using SQL-based analytics. With Pixar being a globally recognized film studio( and my personal favourite), this analysis holds relevance for multiple stakeholders:

Business Analysts & Executives: To understand what drives profitability and critical success.
Creative Teams (Writers, Directors): To assess audience reception, genre performance, and award trends.
Investors & Studio Heads: To evaluate return on investment (ROI), market timing, and long-term success patterns.
Data Enthusiasts: To demonstrate how SQL can uncover deep patterns in entertainment data.
